# Workshop Description
Why a workshop on linear algebra? It’s not just because we (instructors Margot and Nadim) fell in love with linear algebra as undergraduate students. It’s really because if you were to look inside the algorithms we use in data science (and many other areas of science and engineering) you would quickly realize that most building blocks of the algorithms are linear algebra.
If you want to build tools, or if you want to understand the behavior of algorithms better, a strong understanding of linear algebra is super helpful.
 
Of course we cannot do justice to linear algebra in just 6 hours. See this workshop as an appetizer, a first impression, hopefully making you hungry for more. For those of you interested in exploring deeper, we have included in the workshop materials the notes and exercises used in a linear algebra course on campus.
 
During this summer workshop, we will touch on some of the most fundamental linear algebra concepts and operations. We are not assuming any prior knowledge apart from some experience working with vectors in 2D. We will use examples from data science: searching, ranking, a little compression and regression to motivate these concepts. Along the way, we will be introduced to vectors and vector operations,  including the famous dot/inner product , matrix-vector multiplication, matrix-vector systems, the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), QR, and least squares. 

We hope you will enjoy this (first?) foray into linear algebra!

## About the Instructors

![Nadim Saad](/assets/img/nadim-saad-profilephoto.JPG){:style="max-width:40%;"}

Nadim Saad is a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in ICME advised by Professor Margot Gerritsen and will be completing his PhD this summer. He is interested in computational mathematics generally and is working on PDE-based traffic flow modeling. He is from Lebanon and enjoys running, climbing and singing. He will be joining Northeastern University as an Assistant Teaching Professor in Computer Science and Data Science next fall. He says: “Linear Algebra has always been one of my favorite topics ever since I was in undergrad and I’m very excited to share that with everyone”.
