# Workshop Description
Have you ever wondered how Google delivers search results or how Netflix curates personalized movie recommendations? The answer lies in linear algebra. Join us to uncover the underlying principles and applications of linear algebra in data science. Through engaging examples from real-world data science scenarios such as searching, ranking, and regression, you will develop a deeper understanding of vectors and their operations, including the influential dot product. Matrices will also take center stage as we analyze their significance in various contexts, such as representing social networks, solving linear systems, and acting as operators.

Delving further, we will explore different types of matrices, such as orthogonal and triangular matrices, and their frequent application in data science through decompositions like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and QR decomposition. Additionally, we will unravel the inner workings of the PageRank algorithm used by Google in its search engine.

This workshop serves as a tantalizing introduction to linear algebra, aiming to ignite your curiosity and pave the way for further exploration. For those seeking to deepen their knowledge, we will provide accessible resources that expand on the material covered in the workshop. Join us on this exciting journey and uncover the fundamental role of linear algebra in shaping the algorithms driving modern data science.

We hope you will enjoy this (first?) foray into linear algebra!
